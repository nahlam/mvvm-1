# mvvm-1

#What is done
- All code in swift
- I used the minimum data from the API as there is no document for optional and non optional. This might make a problem! as i just made it by sense. for example an article must have at least one image, id, title, author, date, summary and link so i didn't want to use more 
- All code can be tested i just gave a sample test as i didn't have enough time.
- I worked on the JSON files all the time and then converted to the API.
